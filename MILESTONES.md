Milestones
==========


### Development
***
#### Prototype
###### _25.10.13_ Create audio server
Create an audio server that will stream audio to any/all of the clients, based on their localized position. Simulate positioning for now.

###### _25.10.13_ Create socket layer
Create a full duplex socket connection layer, which enables the server and clients to communicate with one another as well as sending async event notifications when events occur.

###### _01.11.13_ Create an stream interface
Create an interface for playing audio on the separate devices. Use this to test audio server and socket layer interoperability.

###### _07.11.13_ Write conducting scripting language
Write a parser for a scripting language that will control the playing of audio samples on a given number of devices. Look at extending it to create some kind of position based query (which will return devices, based on position parameters e.g. to get all the outermost devices)

###### _14.11.13_ Create audio processing at client.
Setup a source to node chain at the client and add support for gain, panning and delay.

###### _21.11.13_ Handle localization
Develop a beeping ping system which enables devices to locate one another, so that they may be positioned at the server.

###### _28.11.13_  Create visualizations
Create some canvas based visualizations for the audio being streamed to the client.

#### Build (_December 2013_)
_To be completed when the prototype has been finished_




### Academic
***
###### _17.10.13_ Title Page
The project title and the name of the author of the report. You can also list the name of your supervisor. 

###### _25.10.13_ Introduction
Introduce the area; explain the problem in a nutshell without going into much technical detail. Explain why this problem merits a special study. Specify the main objective of this project and detail the tasks toward achieving this objective (usually 3-4 tasks). Give the structure of the thesis by explaining each chapter with 1 or 2 sentences.

###### _29.11.13_ Background
Relating the task, methods and approaches to existing published work. Describe and evaluate as many alternative approaches as possible.

###### _03.01.13_ Body of Report
Body of report. The central part of the report usually consists of two or three chapters detailing the technical work undertaken during the project. The structure of these chapters is highly project-dependent. They can reflect the chronological development of 
the project:
- Design
- Implementation
- Experimentation
- Optimisation
- Testing
- Evaluation
- Working practices

###### _17.01.14_ Evaluation
Evaluate what you have done both in absolute terms and in comparison with existing techniques, software, hardware etc

###### _24.01.14_ Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues
Describes any legal, social, ethical or professional issues related to the project topic.

###### _31.01.14_ Conclusions and Future Work
The project's conclusions should list the things which have 
been learnt as a result of the work you have done.

###### _07.02.14_ Abstract
Brief summary of the report's contents. It should be about half a page long. Somebody unfamiliar with your project should have a good idea of what it is about having read the abstract alone.
